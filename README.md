# Final project for Cloud Application Development course.

This is the Portfolio Assignment for CS493: Cloud Application Development F2020. 

## Project Idea:

  * Culmination of everything learned in the course. 
  * Entity to model the user.
  * Minimum of two non-user entites to be related to each other.
  * The user needs to be related to at least one non-user entities.
  * Resources corresponding to the non-user entity related to the user must be protected.
  * Every entity supports all CRUD operations.
  * Use Google Cloud Platform: Datastore for data, Python3, and deploy on Google App Engine.

## Motivation
 
  * Implement a REST API that uses proper resource based URLs, pagination, and status codes. The API will also include methods to create and authorize users.
  
  * Use boat, load, and user entities.

  * Test API with Postman Test Collection.
